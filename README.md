# Game-of-Clones
Custom built, lightweight css framework with a GOT vibe

This is my first run at a css framework to see what all goes to putting it together.  There is still plenty of issues but I learned quite a bit from hacking it together.  If you want to test it out, check out the demo version that has some instructions: https://tallgrassschool.com/cohort_1/students/rt/gameofclones/.  Everything should be good to go just check to make sure you have the correct font downloaded.
